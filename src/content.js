What we do

People are at the heart of our pastries. We hire and train people with intellectual and developmental disabilities to perform tasks from pastry production, customer service, dishwashing, machine maintenance, and inventory management. Our kitchen utilizes volunteer job coaches to assist in vocational training for our employees. We make handmade pastries using quality ingredients, sourcing local, seasonal ingredients as much as possible. Baked with love, always.

Why we do it

 L’Oven was envisioned by pastry chef and special education teacher Twyla Mount. After struggling to find opportunity for her students within the New Orleans school system, Mount decided to advocate for people with special needs in New Orleans by creating alternative pathways to successful lives and gainful employment. In the state of Louisiana, 70% to 80% of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities are unemployed. Of the 20 to 30% of employed individuals, the majority are underemployed and are subject to subminimum wage provisions allows employers to page a wage below the federal minimum to workers with disabilities. Twyla has combined her skill of educating people with special needs with her professional training in pastry to create L’Oven Bakeshop.

Twyla Mount is both an accomplished special education teacher and pastry chef. While receiving her BA in Educational Sociology at Hampshire College in Massachusetts she began her training in French patisserie. She is a licensed special education teacher and strong advocate for her students. Twyla has worked as a pastry chef at Satsuma Café and a continued her training under Chef Beth Biundo at Beth Biundo Sweets. Twyla envisioned L’Oven Bakeshop as a platform for people with exceptionalities to advocate for their willingness and ability to work.`
